                <p>Yesterday I had the opportunity to represent Ubuntu linux at a symposium
held at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a>, organized by
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.unitarny.org/en/symposium.html">UNITAR</a>. Together with
another representative from Novel, I was invited to demonstrate our
operating system and answer any question that may come up during the
event.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="http://static.flickr.com/84/229440210_c668529c98.jpg" /></p>
<p>Together with my new friend <a class="reference external" href="http://eckenrodehouse.net/index.php/?p=706">Nathan
Eckenrode</a> whom I met
approximately 3 weeks ago (he was one of those who answered my post
about getting a free Ubuntu book. We had lunch one day close to my
ex-job), we arrived at the UN around 9:30. It was a pretty “weird” day,
with a very fine mist covering everything and everyone walking in New
York city. We immediately put on our identification badges and went
straight to meeting room #8. The event was set up as a “round
tableÃ¢â‚¬Â? discussion, and right away I could see <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallman">Richard
Stallman</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danese_Cooper">Danese
Cooper</a> sitting across
the room.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="http://static.flickr.com/83/229510729_acc6cebb92.jpg" /> Nathan and I decided not to install Ubuntu into the computer we
were given by the organizers and use the LiveCD instead, so to give us
the opportunity to watch the debate. I was very fascinated with the
several talks, specially with Richard’s radical attitude. He gave me the
impression of a person who thinks in extremes, never considering that
there could be a “in the middle” stance. Still, I was impressed by the
fact that he not only “preaches” his beliefs but is also always acting
them! For instance, when he asked what the format would be to stream the
webcast of the event and received no answer, he stated that had he known
of this before, he would have not accepted to attend the event! I
thought that was precious! The event was attended by several global
delegations, as well as representatives from big companies such as IBM,
Red Hat, Novel, Microsoft, etc. My “job” was to just sit by the
computers provided so the attendees could “test drive” a free operating
system, but those who know me well, know that I am a man of action and
emotions. There were several moments when I just could not control
myself and, for better or worse, spoke up my true beliefs. I don’t know
exactly what (if any) impact my words had, but close to the end of the
first session I pleaded to all delegations present, to go back to their
governments and ask then to at least give open source and free software
a chance! By doing so, I said, they would be freeing their people and
allowing them to get the same access to information so many of us have
taken for granted. <img alt="image2" src="http://static.flickr.com/74/229440216_2dbfd57457.jpg" /> During lunch I had the opportunity to sit
next to Richard and Danese and exchange a few words. Danese was very
receptive and talked about her life, daughter, music, etc. Richard, on
the other had, was very quiet and detached. When Nathan, trying to
initiate a dialog, said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have just tried installing gnash, but
got stuck onÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â?, he was immediate interrupted by Richard, who
replied: Ã¢â‚¬Å“By telling me this you are not helping anyone! Have you
reported the bug? Tried to debug it? ” and he ranted on… Wow!!! It is as
I said before, he seems to be very radical and from what I could also
notice, good with a fork and a knife! <img alt=":)" src="http://blog.ogmaciel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /> I managed to meet some
interesting people from Red Hat, LPI, and Unesco, among others. If there
was one thing I got out of the whole experience was that we have got to
spend less time perfecting the systems, and spend more of it trying to
get it to those who cannot afford to try them!!! What is the point of
translating every single program out there or fixing every bug if only a
minute fraction of the world gets to use it??? Anyhow, Nathan took a few
pictures which I shall publish soon. The webcast for the fist day of the
event (more than 3 hours of duration) is below. If anyone could extract
the parts where I appear and send it to me in a free format, I’d really
appreciate it!
