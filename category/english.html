</div>
<p>For someone who has run his own <a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info/">podcast</a> for several years (albeit
not generating a lot of content lately), it took me quite some time to
actually start <em>listening</em> to podcasts myself. Ironic, I know, but I
guess the main reason behind this was because I was always reading
code at work and eventually, no matter how hard I tried, I just
couldn't pay attention to what was being said! No matter how
interesting the topic being discussed was or how engaging the hosts
(or hosts) were, my brain would be so focused on reading code that
everything else just turned into white noise.</p>
<p>Well, fast forward a couple of years and I still am reading code
(though not as much as I used to due to a new role), and I still have
a hard time listening to podcast while at work... so I decided to only
listen to them when I was <strong>not</strong> working. Simple, right? But it took
me a while to change that for some reason.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I now listen to podcasts while driving (which I don't really
do a lot of since I work from home 99.99% of the time) or when I go
for walks, and after a while I have started following a handful of
them which are now part of my weekly routine:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/allthebooks">All The Books</a> which provide me with an up to date list of
suggestions for what books to read next. They're pretty regular with
their episodes, so I can always count on listening about new books
pretty much every week.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/thepodcast">Book Riot</a> for another dose of more news about books!</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://hacktheentrepreneur.com/">Hack the Entrepreneur</a> to keep up with people who are making
something about what they are passionate about.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://howwegettonext.com/tagged/wonderland-podcast">Wonderland Podcast</a> which I only started listening to a few weeks
back but it has turned into one of my favorite.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://soundcloud.com/science-vs">Science Vs</a> another new addition to my list, with entertaining
takes at interesting topics such as 'the G-spot', 'Fracking', 'Gun
Control' and 'Organic Food'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I was introduced to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia">Invisibilia</a> and though I only listened to
the first 10 minutes (I was giving the link during working hours, so
no go for me), I'm already very interested and will follow it.</p>
<p>I do have other podcasts that I am still subscribed to, but these
listed here are the ones that I am still following every episode.
Maybe if I had to drive to work every day or went for walks more
often, maybe then I would listen to more podcasts? Trust me though, I
rather continue listening to only a small set of them than drive to
work every day. Don't get me wrong, I <strong>love</strong> going to work, but
that's 2 hours/day of my life that I rather spend at home :)</p>

<p>Another year has gone by and I guess it is time to review the things I
set out to do and grade myself on how well (or poorly) I fared. Here
are some of my goals for 2015:</p>
<div class="section" id="read-70-books">
<h2>Read 70 Books</h2>
<p>Grade: <strong>PASS</strong></p>
<p>Even though I had a very, very busy year at work, with many releases
of <strong>Red Hat Satellite 5</strong> and <strong>Red Hat Satellite 6</strong> shipped to our
customers, I managed to surpass my goal of reading 70 books, finishing
the year with a whopping <strong>79</strong> books read! You can see the books I
read here: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/12048315">Year in Books</a></p>
<p>This year I also spent a good chunk of my time looking at old, used
books, and my personal book collection increased considerably. At one
point I had so many piles of books lying around the house that I had
to buy 4 new book cases to store them. At first I wanted to have them
custom made, but the estimates I got from 3-4 different people were
way out of my budget. In the end I went with 4 <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40279788/#/40263848">Billy Bookcases</a> from
Ikea, which cost me about 10 times less!</p>
<p>If you want to see what I'm reading or want to recommend a book which
you think I might enjoy reading, please feel free to add me on

<p>This <strong>August 2015</strong> I took a break from work and spent about 6 days
enjoying some R&amp;R down the North Carolina shore with my family. I
managed to get through some of the books that were waiting for a long
time for me to get to them, as well as try some new authors.</p>
<div class="section" id="read">
<h2>Read</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Sentinel">The Sentinel</a> by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Arthur+C.+Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a></p>
<p>I forgot where I read about how the short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was the inspiration for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, but being that I have always considered the latter a great book and movie, I managed to grab a copy of the anthology &quot;The Sentinel&quot; just so that I could read the short story by the same name and see what else Arthur C. Clarke &quot;had to offer.&quot; Interestingly enough (to me), most if not all the other short stories included in this collection could easily be published today and still feel just as futuristic as they probably were back when they were first published! This was yet another one of the books that I read by the beach this Summer and though it didn't blow me away, it was still a very relaxing read.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=A+Princess+of+Mars">A Princess of Mars</a> by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Edgar+Rice+Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a></p>
<p>This last June I got from my family for my birthday &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; containing the complete series and I was just itching for a good opportunity to start reading it. That chance came up this week as I started reading some of Melville's short stories and found that I needed a bit of a &quot;break&quot;. First off, I have never read Edgar Rice Burroughs before but I do have a copy of &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; also awaiting for a chance, so I had an idea about what to expect from his style. Sure enough, reading &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; felt like a taking a trip down memory's lane, back when it was easy to tell who the good and the bad guys were, and there was always a damsel in distress somewhere waiting to be rescued. I have to confess that it took me a few chapters to get re-acclimated with this style, but once I got into it, it was easy reading, which is exactly what I was looking for any how.</p>
<p>John Carter, the main character, shows all the expected, cliché virtues one would expect from a &quot;hero&quot; but one thing that bothered me a bit was the language he used to describe those who were different from him (which was mostly everyone in the story, since they were all Martians) and the way he treated them. It felt a bit abusive and even a but racist? I don't know if someone could get away with writing in the same style today, but then again I remembered that back then people were not as politically correct as we are today... or maybe I was reading too much into it? Anyhow, it was a fun read and I think I will try to add the next 4 books of the series in the coming months so that I can hopefully get a better opinion formed about the author.</p>

<p>This <strong>July 2015</strong> I travelled to the <strong>Red Hat</strong> office in <strong>Brno, Czech Republic</strong> to spend some time with my teammates there, and I managed to get a lot of reading done between long plane rides and being jet lagged for many nights :) So I finally managed to finish up some of the books that had been lingering on my <em>ToDo</em> list and even managed to finally read a few of the books that together make up the <strong>Chronicles of Narnia</strong>, since I had never read them as a kid.</p>

</ul>
<p>Out of all the books I read this month, I feel that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front">All Quiet on the Western Front</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+October+Country">The October Country</a> were the ones I enjoyed reading the most, closely followed by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a>, which took me a while to get through. The other books, with the exception of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes">The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</a>, helped me pass the time when I only wanted to be entertained.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front">All Quiet on the Western Front</a> takes the prize for being one of the best books I have ever read! I felt that the way <strong>WWI</strong> was presented through the eyes of the main character was a great way to represent all the pain, angst and suffering that all sides of conflict went through, without catering for any particular side or having an agenda. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Erich+Maria+Remarque">Erich Maria Remarque</a>'s style had me some times breathless, some times with a knot on the pit of my stomach I as 'endured' the many life changing events that took place in the book. Is this an action-packed book about WWI? Will it read like a thriller? In my opinion, even though there are many chapters with gory details about killings and battles, the answer is a very bland 'maybe'. I think that the real 'star' of this book is its philosophical view of the war and how the main characters, all around 19-20 years of age, learn to deal with its life lasting effects.</p>
<p>Now, I have been a huge fan of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ray+Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> for a while now, and when I got <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+October+Country">The October Country</a> for my birthday last month, I just knew that it would be time well spent reading it. For those of you who are more acquainted his science fiction works, this book will surprise you as it shows you a bit of  his 'darker' side. All of the short stories included in this collection deal with death, mysterious apparitions, inexplicable endings and are sure to spook you a little bit.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a> was at times slow, some other times funny and, especially toward the end, a very entertaining book. Weighing in at a hefty 1000 pages (depending on the edition you have, plus/minus 50 odd pages), this book covers two different periods in the lives of a number of different characters, past (around <strong>WWII</strong>) and present, all different threads eventually leading to a great finale. Alternating between past and present, the story takes us to the early days of how <strong>cryptology</strong> was 'officially invented' and used during the war, and how many of the events that took place back then were affecting the lives of some of the direct descendants of the main characters in our present day. As you go through the back and forth you start to gather bits and pieces of information that eventually connects all the dots of an interesting puzzle. It definitely requires a long term commitment to go though it, but it was enjoyable and, as I mention before, it made me laugh at many places.</p>

<p>Those of you who know me know that I am a huge book reader and spend most of my free time reading several books at the same time. One could say that reading is one of my passions, and having wasted so many years after high school completely ignoring this passion (in exchange for spending most of my time trying to learn about <strong>Linux</strong>, get an education, a job and, let's be frank, chasing after girls), I decided that something had to be done about it, and starting around 2008 I 'forced' myself to dedicate at least one solid hour of reading <strong>for fun</strong> every day.</p>
<p>I find it funny to say that I had to <strong>force</strong> myself, but this statement is very much true. Being so used to spending all of my time sitting in front of a computer and getting flooded with information every single minute of the day (IRC, Twitter, Facebook, commit emails, RSS feeds, etc), I found it difficult to 'unplug' and spend time doing nothing but focusing on only one thing. I was so used to multitasking and being constantly bombarded with lots of information that sitting quietly and reading didn't feel very productive to me... sad but true.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after several 'agonizing' months of getting up from my desk and making a point of turning off my cel phone and finding a quiet place somewhere in the building (or at home during the weekends), I finally got into the habit of reading for pleasure. I actually looked forward to these reading periods (imagine that, huh?) and eventually I realized that if I skipped  this 'ritual' even one day, my days felt like they got longer and I felt stressed out and irritable for the remaining of the day. Reading became not only a good habit but my mechanism for relaxing and recharging my energies during the day!</p>
<p>Well, this passion and appetite for reading has only gotten bigger, and with time I have to say that it has become a pretty big part of who I am today! In a way I am happy that it took me this long to get back into the habit of reading... I mean, I feel that getting older was an important part of preparing myself so that I could really appreciate <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=John+Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ray+Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> and the likes of them! Would I have truly appreciated <strong>The Grapes of Wrath</strong> when I was younger? Perhaps... but it took me around 40 years to get to it and I'm happy that when it did I was able to appreciate this amazing piece of art!</p>
<p>These last few months I decided that I wanted to start tracking all the books that I read, buy or receive as a gift every month (see my reading progress on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12048315-og-maciel">GoodReads</a> and add me as a friend), and jot down some of my impressions and motives for reading or buying them. Those familiar with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Nick+Hornby">Nick Hornby</a> will probably associate this post (and hopefully others that will surely come) with the work he has done writing for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.believermag.com/">Believer Magazine</a> ... and this would be correct. My intention is not to copy his style or anything like that, but I thought that the format he chose to report on his own reading 'adventures' would fit in quite nicely with what I wanted to get across to my readers... and I'm sticking with the format as long as it works for me :)</p>

I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I
really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time,
read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much
younger.</p>

flown by and I really cannot believe that it has been three years since
I joined this company.</p>
<p>I know it is sort of cliche to say &quot;I can not believe that it has been
this long...&quot; and so on and so forth, but it is so true. Back then I
joined a relatively new project with very high ambitions, and the first
few months had me swimming way out in the deepest part of the pool,
trying to learn all 'Red Hat-things' and <strong>Clojure</strong> for the existing
automation framework (now we are fully using <strong>Python</strong>).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and
Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu
family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their
Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for
the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even
during working hours, that eventually I sort of &quot;made a name for myself&quot;
and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.</p>
<p>Then I &quot;graduated&quot; and started doing translations for the upstream
projects, such as GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, and Openbox. I took on more
responsabilities, learned to use Git and make commits for myself as well
as for other contributors, and strived to unify all Brazilian Portuguese
translations across as many different projects as possible. Many
discussions were had, (literally) hundreds of hours were spent going
though also hundreds of thoundands of translations for hundreds of
different applications, none of it bringing me any monetary of financial
advantage, but all done for the simple pleasure of knowing that I was
helping make FOSS applications &quot;speak&quot; Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
