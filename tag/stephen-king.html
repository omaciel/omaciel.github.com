<p>This week I started reading <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7143113-on-writing">On Writing</a>: A Memoir of the Craft by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King">Stephen King</a>, a book that has been mentioned a few times by people I usually interview for my weekly <a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info/">podcast</a> as something that is both inspiring and has had a major impact on their lives and careers. After the third or forth time someone metioned I finally broke down and got myself a copy at the local bookstore.</p>
<p>I have to say that, so far, I am completely blown away by this book! I can totally see why everyone else recommended it as something that people should add to their BTR (Books To Read) list! First of all, the first section of the book, which Stephen King calls his 'C.V.' (and not his memories or auto biography), covers his early life as a child, his experiences and struggles (there are quite a few passages that will most likely get you to laugh out loud) growing up with his mom and older brother, Dan. This section, roughly speaking around 100 pages or so, are so easy to relate to that you can probably be done with them in about 2 hours no matter what your reading pace is. I am always captivated to learn how someone 'came to be', the real 'behind the scenes' if you will, of how someone started out their lives and the paths they took to get to where they are now.</p>
<p>The next sections talk about what any aspiring writer should add to their 'toolbox' and it covers many interesting topics and suggestions which, if you really think about it, makes a ton of sense. This is where I am in the book right now, and though it isn't as captivating as the first section, it should still appeal to anyone looking for solid advice on how to become a better writer in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Though I one day do aspire to become a published writer (fiction most likely), and I am enjoying this book that I'm having a real hard time putting it down, the reason why I chose to write about it is related to a piece of advice that Stephen King shares with the reader about the habit of reading.</p>
<p>Stephen King claims that, to become a better writer one must at least obey the following rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Read every day!</li>
<li>Write every day!</li>
</ul>
<p>It is by reading a lot (something that should come naturaly to anyone who reads every day) that one learns new vocabulary words, different styles of prose, how to structure ideas into paragraphs and rhytm. He says that it doesn't matter if you read in 'tiny sips' or in huge 'swallows', but as long as you continue to read every day, you'll develop a great and, in his opinion, required habit for becoming a better writer. Obviously, based on his two rules you'd need to write every day too, and if you're one of us who is toying with the idea of becoming a witer one day (or want to become a better writer), I too highly recommend that you give this book a shot! I know, I know, I have not finished it yet but still... I <strong>highly</strong> recommend it!</p>
<p>Back to the habit of reading and the purpose of this post, I remember back in 2008 my own 'struggle' to 'find the time' to read non technical books. You know, reading for fun? Back then I was doing a lot of reading, but mostly it consisted of blog posts and articles recommended by my RSS feeds, and since I was very much involved with a lot of different open source projects, I mostly read about GNOME, KDE, Ubuntu and Python. Just the thought of reading a book that did not cover any of these topics gave me a feeling of uneasiness and I couldn't picture myself dedicating time, precious time, to reading 'for fun.' But eventually I realized that I needed to add a bit more variety to my reading experience and that sitting in front of my computer during my lunch break would not help me with this at all. There were too many distractions to lure me away from any book I may be trying to read.</p>
<p>I started out by picking up a book that everyone around me had mentioned many times as being 'wicked cool' and 'couldn't put it down' kind of book. Back then I worked at a startup and most of the engineers around me were much younger than me and at one point or another most of them were into 'the new Harry Potter' book. I confess that I felt judgemental and couldn't fanthom the idea of reading a 'kid book' but since I was trying to create a new habit and since my previous attempts had failed miserably, I figured that something drastic was just what the doctor would have recommended. One day after work, before driving back home, I stopped by the public library and picked up <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a>.</p>
<p>Next day at work when I took my lunch break, I locked my laptop and went downstairs to a quiet corner of the building's lobby. I picked a nice, confy seat with a lot of natural sun light andview of the main entrance and started reading... or at least I thought I did. Whenever I started to read a paragraph, sommeone would open the door at the main entrance to the building either on their way in or out, and with them went my focus and my mind would start wandering. Eventually I'd catch myself and back to the book my eyes went, only to be disrupted by the next person opening the door. Needless to say, experiment 'Get More Reading Done' was an utter failure!</p>
