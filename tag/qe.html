                <h2><a href="https://omaciel.github.io/just-what-is-a-quality-engineer-part-2.html">Just What Is A Quality Engineer? Part 2</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><img alt="Picture of `Batman`_" class="align-left" src="images/batman-is-qe.jpeg" style="width: 25pc; height: 25pc;" />
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://omaciel.github.io/just-what-is-a-quality-engineer-part-1.html">last time</a> I wrote about <strong>Quality Engineering</strong>, I mentioned that some of the reasons why people are not familiar with this term are, in no particular order:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>'Quality' is usually something that is added as an after thought and doesn't really come into the picture, if ever, until the very end of the release process</li>
<li>Nobody outside of a QA team really knows what they do. It has something to do with testing...</li>
<li>Engineering is usually identified with skills related to writing code and designing algorithms, usually by a developer and not by QA</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick search on Google shows the following results:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>104,000,000 hits for &quot;Software Engineer&quot;</li>
<li>86,900,000 hits for “Quality Control”</li>
<li>83,100,000 hits for “Quality Assurance”</li>
<li>5,390,000 hits for “Quality Engineer”</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it is no wonder that whenever I say 'quality engineer' people always think that what I really meant to say was 'quality assurance' or 'quality control'. The term is just not that well-known! So in order to clarify what the difference is between these professions, today I'd like to talk a little bit about <strong>quality assurance</strong> and what I usually think whenever someone tells me that they either work in QA or have a 'QA team'.</p>
<p>Wikipedia tells us that the terms 'quality assurance' (QA) and 'quality control' (QC) are often used interchangeably to refer to ways of ensuring the quality of a service or product.</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Quality assurance comprises administrative and procedural activities implemented in a quality system so that <strong>requirements</strong> and goals for a product, service or activity will be <strong>fulfilled</strong>. It is the systematic <strong>measurement</strong>, <strong>comparison</strong> with a standard, <strong>monitoring</strong> of processes and an associated <strong>feedback loop</strong> that confers <strong>error prevention</strong>.&quot;
-- <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
<p>That is quite a mouth full (the emphasized words are mine), but I feel that it does a good job at stating the following ideas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Quality Assurance and/or Quality Control is used to assure the quality of a product, but there is no clear distinction as to when in the release process it should be used. In my experience, it usually happens when the product is close to being shipped!</li>
<li>Used to make sure that <strong>requirements</strong> (the what) are <strong>fulfilled</strong> (the how)</li>
<li>Used to measure, monitor and compare results against a standard</li>
<li>Used for error preventions (which to me denotes a reactive mode compared to a proactive mode)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, those who do quality assurance for a living are involved in verifying that the final version of the product being tested delivers exactly what was designed with the expected behavior and outcome. It requires that the QA person fully understand what is being added to or changed in the product and, most importantly, what the end result should be. Testing is definitely a big part of the 'day to day' activities for someone in QA, which does provide useful information to create a positive feedback loop and hopefully increase error prevention.</p>
<p>Here's what I don't like about this whole business though:</p>
<p>Quality is something that must be part of all phases of a product and <strong>not</strong> at the very end of the process. A good QA person is usually so familiar with the product being tested that one could say that QA <strong>is</strong> the first customer a company has! If you have someone in your team who can fully understand how your product works, where the pain points are, knows at a glance if a new feature or a fix does not follow the existing standards, and has the ability to tell you if something doesn't feel right, would you want to hear this type of feedback at the very end? By then, can you really afford to put things on hold and re-design your product??? In my experience, the answer to this question has 99.99% of the time been 'No'.</p>
<p>Quality is the responsibility of everyone involved with a product and not only of those in QA! Everyone, document writers, translators, user experience (UX) experts, product managers, you name it, everyone should be in the business of delivering and assuring the quality of the product! If you bought something, would you be OK with accepting mediocre user experience, documentation, features and translations? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Monitoring and measuring how a product compares against some set of standardized benchmarks is definitely important but as customers request more and more new features and the product's complexity increases, are your benchmarks also keeping up with all these changes? More importantly, since <strong>you</strong> are the one using the product day and night, do you have any input into updating the benchmarks? I certainly hope so.</p>
<p>Lastly, if your job is to make sure that no product 'goes out the door' without a thorough validation, that it works as expected and that all known issues have been fixed, aren't you forgetting something? What about the issues that are not known yet? You may be thinking that I'm joking, but seriously. If all you do is prevent errors from being shipped to your customers, how about detecting them as early as possible to give all major stake-holders enough time to make a decision as to what should be done with them? Again, if you're catching them at the end of the release cycle, it could be too late.</p>
<p>If your company has a QA team, then you're already ahead of the game, since it is only when customer dissatisfaction is very high and the final numbers for the quarter start to look gloomy that people start paying attention to delivering quality. But it is not enough if you're only kicking the can down the road only to find yourself facing the same scenario later on! Quality, good quality, is what everyone in your team should be striving for... not some times, but all the time!</p>
<p>If you are in a QA team, do you ever feel like you're ahead of the game or feel like you're constantly playing catch up? Do you wish you could have a chance to catch issues as early as possible? Wouldn't you want to stop racing against the clock to get issues verified and have a shot at doing more exploratory testing and identify problems early on? Would you say 'no' to an opportunity to provide some insight into how the product could be improved and perhaps how some work-flows could be simplified to increase the usability?</p>
<p>It should be clear by now that quality is something that should be something systemic for any project or company who takes their customer satisfaction as their top priority! Sure you can test the product as much as you (or your QA team) can handle, but you'd be only treating the symptoms. Maintaining a 'quality first' mentality and improving existing processes to make sure that quality is an integral part of everyone's day to day activities is primordial if you really want to make a bigger impact!</p>
<p>This is when a Quality Engineer comes in! A Quality Engineer is someone who can actively and continuously keep driving improvements to the release cycle process and are in the unique position to help the entire team adopt these improvements so that everyone is using the same methodologies.</p>
<p>Next time I will then talk about <strong>quality engineering</strong> (QE), what it is, what it isn't, and how you should be either hiring more QE or, if you're in QA, how you should be working to become a QE!</p>
<p>As always, please let me know what your thoughts are on this topic as I'd live to get some constructive feedback!</p>

                <h2><a href="https://omaciel.github.io/just-what-is-a-quality-engineer-part-1.html">Just What Is A Quality Engineer? Part 1</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><img alt="Picture of `Batman`_" class="align-left" src="images/batman-is-qe.jpeg" style="width: 25pc; height: 25pc;" />
<p>Whenever I meet someone for the first time, after we get past the initial niceties typically involved when you meet someone for the first time, eventually the conversation shifts to work and what one does for a living. Inevitably I'm faced with what, at a first glance, may sound like a simple question and the conversation goes like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New acquaintance: &quot;What do you do at Red Hat?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;I manage a team of quality engineers for a couple of different products.&quot;</li>
<li>New acquaintance: &quot;Oh, you mean quality assurance, right? QA?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;No, quality <strong>engineers</strong>. QE.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>What usually followed then was a lengthy monologue whereby I spent usually around ten to fifteen minutes explaining what the difference between QA and QE is and what, in my opinion, sets these two professions apart. Now, before I get too deep into this topic, I have to add a disclaimer here so not to give folks the impression that what I'm talking about is backed by any official definition or some type of professional trade organization! The following are my own definitions and conclusions, none of which were pulled out of thin air, but backed by (so far) 10 years of experience working on the field of delivering quality products. If there are formal definitions out there, and they match with my own, it is by pure coincidence.</p>
<p>Why the term 'Quality Engineer' is not well known I'm not sure, but I have a hunch that it may be related to something I noticed throughout the 10 years that I have spent on this field. In my personal experience, 'quality' is something that is not always considered as part of the creation of a new company, product or project. Furthermore, the term 'quality' is also not well defined or understood by those involved in actually attempting to 'get more' of it.</p>
<p>In my experience, folks usually forget about the word 'quality', whatever that may be, happily start planning and developing their new ideas/products and eventually ship it to their customers. If the customer complains that something is not working or performing as advertised or it doesn't meet their expectations, no problem. Someone will convey the feedback back to the developers, a fix will eventually be provided and off it goes to the customer. Have you ever seen this before? I have!</p>
<p>Eventually, assuming that the business is doing well and is attracting more paying customers, it is highly likely that support requests or requests for new features will increase. After all, who wants to pay for something that doesn't work as expected? Also, who doesn't want a new feature of their own either? Depending on the size of the company and the number of new requests going into their backlog, I'd expect that either one of the following events would then take place:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>More tasks from the backlog would be added to individual's 'plates', or</li>
<li>New associates would be hired to handle the volume of tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess one could also stop accepting new requests for support or new features, but that would not make your customers happy, would it?</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, the influx of new tasks is dealt with and if things get out of control again, one could always try to get an intern or distribute tasks more evenly. Now, notice how the word 'quality' has not been mentioned yet? It is no accident that to solve an increase of more work, most often than not the number one solution used is to throw more resources at it. There's even a name for this type of 'solution': <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a>.</p>
<p>You see, sadly, 'quality' is something that usually only becomes important as an afterthought. It is the last piece added to the puzzle that comprises the machinery of delivering something to an end user. It is only when enough angry and unsatisfied paying customers make enough noise about the unreliability or usability of the product that folks start asking: &quot;Was this even tested before being put on the market?&quot;</p>
<p>If the pain being inflicted by customer feedback is sharp enough, a <strong>Quality Assurance</strong> (QA) team is hastily put together. Most of the time in my experience, this is a Team of One usually made up of one of the developers who after being dragged kicking and screaming from his cubicle, eventually is beat into accepting his new role as a button pusher, text field filler, testing guy. Issues are then assigned to him and a general sense of relief is experienced by all. Have you also seen this before? I have! I'm 2 for 2 so far!</p>
<p>The idea is that by creating a team of one to sit in the receiving end of the product release cycle, nothing would get shipped until some level of 'quality' is achieved. The fallacy with this statement, however, is that no matter how agile your team may be, the assurance of the quality for a product somehow is still part of a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a>. Wouldn't it be better if problems were caught as early as possible in the process instead of waiting until the very end? To me that is a no brainer but somehow the process of testing a product is still relegated to the very end, usually when the date for the release is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Why is the term <strong>Quality Engineer</strong> not well known then? I feel that the answer is comprised of several parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>'Quality' doesn't come into the picture, if ever, until the very end of the game;</li>
<li>If there is a QA team, nobody outside of that team really knows what they do. It has something to do with testing...</li>
<li>Engineering is usually identified with skills related to writing code and designing algorithms, usually by a developer and not by QA;</li>
</ul>
<p>No surprise that quality engineering is something foreign to most!</p>
<p>OK, so what <strong>is</strong> a <strong>Quality Engineer</strong> then? Glad you asked! The answer to that I shall provide in a subsequent post, as I still need to cover some more ground and talk about what 'quality' is, what someone in QA does and finally what is a QE!</p>
<p>My next article will continue this journey through the land of Quality and Engineering, and in the meantime, please let me know what you think about this subject.</p>
