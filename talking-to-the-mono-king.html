                <p>This last Friday was the second day of my trip to Boston. The agenda was
very simple and yet had all the ingredients to an unforgetable day.
Having swapped a few emails with Miguel De Icaza where I convinced him
to meet me and give me a tour of Ximian’s office in Cambridge, we had
finally settled I’d meet him during his lunch break. My friend Vinny and
I left his house around 11am figuring it would take us about 30-40
minutes to get there but we were not counting on getting lost on the
way. Hehehehe… So around 12:25 we arrived at 8 Cambridge Center and told
the doorwoman that we were supposed to meet Miguel. What followed next
were a series of phone calls between the doorwoman, someone from Novell,
and us where Viiny and I were drilled interrogatory-like by the Novell
person about our intentions with this meeting. Now, I understand that it
may have sounded very weird to her when we pretty much stated that we
were “enthusiasts that had swapped emails with Miguel and had arranged
for a agenda-less meeting during lunch.” “What company do you work for,”
she asked. “We’re not here representing a company,” we replied reciting
the “we’re enthusiasts” mantra again. After some 15-20 frustrating
minutes during which I felt like turning around and forgetting about the
whole thing, we were finally allowed to go up to the 5th floor.</p>
<p>By then I was feeling pretty bad about the whole thing and it felt now
that we were bothering people. We did go up to the 5th floor
nevertheless only to wait another 10 minutes in front of the
Ximian-logoed door. Eventually a young woman opened the door and took us
to a lounge where a lot of the Gnome/Mono hackers were having a pizza
party. She had us wait by the fuzzball table while she approached Miguel
to let him know his visitors were there. What a Kodak moment that was
when I say the look on Miguel’s face. He looked completely dumbfound and
seemed to have completely forgotten about our agreement. Vinny and I
wanted to jump out of the window but patiently sat down and waited for
another 10 minutes while Miguel talked to someone who looked to be a big
cheese from Novell. During those looong 10 minutes I looked around and
recognized several hackers including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnome.org/~michael/">Michael
Meeks</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://nat.org/">Nat
Friedman</a>. What a cool bunch they were hanging out
in the lounge, munching down their pizza and chugging down their colas.
I confess that at that moment I became extremelly depressed with my
current job and hoped nobody would ask me about it so I wouldn’t have to
remember it.</p>
<p>Finally we were approached by Miguel and time stood still for what it
seemed a long time. We introduced ourselves and talked about several
different subjects, mostly involving Mono and Microsoft. He gave us the
inside scoop of where Mono is headed for the next year or so and also
about the new additions to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>
to support the newly added Windows.Forms namespace. He also showed
genuine interest in our suggestion of a free Mono code boot camp event
and was only concerned if people would actually show up. I also
suggested they create a Live CD with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mono-project.com/about/index.html">Mono</a> and MonoDevelop
included as part of the default boot. In the end he gave us both a cool
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html">Evolution</a>
t-shirt and told us he had to do talk to someone about a bug that
something during our conversation reminded him of.</p>
<p>Overall I’m glad I stuck to the whole thing despite my initial feelings
that we were disturbing him.</p>
