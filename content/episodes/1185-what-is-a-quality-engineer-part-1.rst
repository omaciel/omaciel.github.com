Whenever I meet someone for the first time, after we get past the initial niceties typically involved during the initial awkward moments, eventually the conversation shifts to work and what one does for a living. Inevitably I'm faced with what, at a first glance, may sound like a simple question:

* New acquaintance: "What do you do at Red Hat?"
* Me: "I manage a team of quality engineers for a couple of different products."
* New acquaintance: "Oh, you mean quality assurance, right? QA?"
* Me: "No, quality **engineers**. QE."

What follows then is a lenghty monologue whereby I spend usually around ten to fifteen minutes explaining what the difference between QA and QE is and what, in my opinion, sets these two professions apart. Now, before I get too deep into this topic, I have to add a disclaimer here so not to give folks the impression that what I'm about to talk about is backed by any official definition or some type of professional trade organization! The following are my own definitions and conclusions, none of which were pulled out of thin air, but backed by (so far) 10 years of experience working on the field of delivering quality products. If there are formal definitions out there, I'm not aware of them but feel free to send them to me.

Why the term 'Quality Engineer' is not well known I'm not sure, but I have a hunch that it may be related to something I noticed throughout the 10 years that I have spend on this field. In my personal experience, 'quality' is something that is not always considered as part of the creation of a new company, product or project. Furthermore, the term 'quality' is also not well definied or understood by those involved in actually attempting to 'get more' of it.

In my experience, folks usually forget about the word 'quality', whatever that may be, happily plan and develop their new ideas/products and eventually ship it to their customers. If the customer complains that something is not working or performing as advertised or it doesn't meet their expectations, no problem. Someone will convey the feedback back to the developers, a fix will eventually be provided and off it goes to the customer. Have you every seen this before? I have!

Eventually, assuming that the business is doing well and are attracting more paying customers, it is very likely that support requests or requests for new features will increase. After all, who wants to pay for something that doesn't work as as expected? Who doesn't want a new feature of their own either? Depending on the size of company and the number of new requests going into their backlog, I'd expect that either one of the following events would take place:

* More tasks from the backlog would be added to individual's 'plates', or
* New associates would be hired to handle the volume of tasks

I guess one could also stop accepting new requests for support or new features, but that would be closing the door to the possibility of making more money, wouldn't?

Regardless of the outcome,
